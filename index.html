             If you want to set up Visual Studio Code, then all you have to do is type Visual Studio Code and then you will get links connecting to the app. Go to the Download Link, and it will take you to the downloding page and you will get three options, they will show what to download on what device. Once you have done that, there will be a thing at the bottem of your screen. Once it is done loading, click on it and you will automaticly go to the desktop, get the app out of the finder and out into the desktop. Then you click on the app and you will get a thing that has three options. Click on opean, and you will get to the welcome screen of Visual Studio Code

        <p>My console shows the way of how to set up this app. It also tells why console apps are used for. The console app is used for displaying things like setting up things or showing other stuff. It is also a good way to show stuff like in bussniss meetings </p>
